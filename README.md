# Graphite & Diamonds Revamped

Adds elemental carbon items to the game, including flake graphite, graphite, diamonds, graphene, and optionally fullerenes, nanotubes, and carbon black. It also adds a crucible intermediate.

Flake graphite is a mineable resource that is processed into graphite. Graphite can be used in certain recipes, and can be further processed into diamonds and graphene. Optionally (default on), graphite can be processed into fullerenes and then nanotubes. Also optionally (default off), carbon black is available as a byproduct of oil processing, used to make plastic. You can enable mineable diamonds in the mod settings.

**If you don't own the Space Age DLC, you need to disable the recommended *Basic Crusher* mod or the base game won't load.**

## Remarks

This revamp drops support for overhaul mods completely and currently Space Age too. Adding recycler and/or quality mod should still be possible. The focus lies at the moment to provide a consistent experience for the base game. Space Age support will be re-added in the future, as well as support for more modded planets.

I try to keep the mod as compatible as possible with other small content mods it already supported. But I could not identify every mod that the original supports, as the original code doesn't provide a consistent way to check for them.

If you want to see your favorite mod supported, please open a discussion thread on the mod portal, or an issue on GitHub, or join the Discord server and let me know.

## Compatible mods

The following mods have their recipes changed:

t.d.b.

ᵃ: As of 2026-08-01 this mod is not yet available for Factorio 2.1. The compatibility layer for this mod is still included, so if the mod is updated for Factorio 2.1, the compatibility will be applied automatically.
